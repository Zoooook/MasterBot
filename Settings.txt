; This file is used in the actual bot, so be careful while editing it.

; Most settings in this file are in the form <Variable>=<Value>
; Some of them are in the form <Variable>:="<Value>" or <Variables>:=[<Value1>,<Value2>]
; Many of these settings are boolean (binary) values. This means that 0 is off and 1 is on.
; You should never edit the variable name itself.
; You should edit the value according to what the description says the variable does.

Control=0
NumFleets=0
    ; These settings tells the bot what its current main function is. I recommend leaving both Control and NumFleets set
    ; at 0, and the bot will auto-detect what to do next. The possible disadvantage to this is that it will always
    ; dismiss your fleets and set up the correct formation, so if you are restarting the bot and it already has the
    ; correct formation set up, then this is a waste of time. If you change this to a different number, then the bot
    ; will assume that it has the corresponding correct formation already set up. 1 is restricteds, 2 is trials, 3 is
    ; constellations, 4 is instances, and 5 is nothing (it won't run any instances but will do other tasks like
    ; harvesting, etc.). If you change the Control setting from 0 then you must also change NumFleets to however many
    ; fleets you have in the current formation. I may try to autodetect NumFleets in a future release. [Nope.] You
    ; should change this back to 0 after starting the bot, so that you don't accidentally leave it on something else the
    ; next time you start it.

OpenBrowser=0
    ; If OpenBrowser is set to 1, the bot will open a Chrome window when it starts. You may set this to 0 if you already
    ; have a Chrome window open, but you need to make sure that you have all the correct browser settings in effect from
    ; the readme. Also, tab 1 should be on facebook.com, tab 2 should exist, and there should not be a large number of
    ; tabs, so that when the bot tries to click on tab 2 it doesn't accidentally click on tab 3.

    ; I can't guarantee that setting OpenBrowser=1 works. It probably doesn't.

LogMain=1
    ; If LogMain is set to 1, the bot will make sure that your main account is logged into Facebook. If it is set to 0,
    ; the bot will assume that the correct Facebook account is already logged in, and go immediately to the GO2 website.

ScrollNum=3
    ; Go to go2.igg.com, scroll to the top of the page, and press the down arrow until the game window is where you want
    ; it. Set ScrollNum to the number of times you pressed the down arrow. I recommend pushing this as high as possible
    ; so that the Play link is visible at the top left of the game window, which is probably 2. Windows bubbles like to
    ; pop up from the system tray at the bottom right of the screen, and it's best if they don't cover up menu buttons
    ; in the game. Your screen resolution needs to be high enough that the entire game window is visible, down to the
    ; bottom of the chat box, and the little circle in the lower right. Facebook friends don't need to be on screen.
TruceDies=-1
    ; If TruceDies is set (number of minutes from midnight), the bot will dismiss all your fleets when your truce is
    ; 15 minutes away from dying. This is unreliable as your bot might be messing with alts at the time, or an instance
    ; might take longer than 15 minutes. Just leave it set to -1 and handle your own truce.

Go2Address:="go2.igg.com"
    ; Set Go2Address to whatever the address for the HD version is for you. For example, you may need to change it to
    ; go2eu.igg.com if you are playing on a European server.
DefaultClickDelay=1200
    ; DefaultClickDelay controls how long the bot waits, in milliseconds, in between mouse clicks. All wait times are
    ; multiples of this number. 1000 is a good number, but if you start running into lag errors, where the game isn't
    ; keeping up with the bot, then increase it to 1200 or higher. Image detection is heavily used to protect against
    ; lag errors, but there's no way to make it 100% lag proof. To keep your lag times low, make sure there are no
    ; unnecessary programs running on your computer while the bot is running, and close extra browser tabs.
IdleWait=120
    ; IdleWait controls how long the bot waits, in seconds, for your computer to be idle before re-activating itself, if
    ; you have switched tabs or windows to do something else. This is not 100% perfect; I would not recommend switching
    ; while the bot is logging in and out of facebook or the game. The best way is to hit the Pause hotkey, then switch,
    ; then switch back, then hit the Pause hotkey again, but this setting is a backup option in case you accidentally
    ; switch windows and forget to go back to the game. It will not work if the bot is actually paused.

    ; LeftSide is anywhere to the left of the game window on go2.igg.com, on the background of the page. EnterGame

; Disclaimer: All descriptions after this point were done about 6 months after I last touched the program.
    
Midnight=1
    ; If Midnight is set to 1, the bot will run the daily routine when it starts. It will initially skip the routine if
    ; set to 0. No matter what the setting, it will still do the routine whenever game time hits midnight. If I remember
    ; correctly, setting it to 2 and 3 are only for internal use of the program, so don't do it.
RocksTime=300
    ; RocksTime controls when the bot harvests your space rocks, when it is initially started. After the first time, it
    ; will set this automatically. This number is the number of minutes from midnight. So noon is 720. If set to -1, it
    ; will harvest them immediately upon starting.

    ; How many instance boxes to open at a time.

    ; You may only need to open every other box or every third box in order to keep enough He3 around. Instance boxes
    ; are opened while an instance is running, so if you have a large number of boxes saved up, it may be most time
    ; effective to open 5 or 10 boxes after each instance run. The bot will automatically know if all your instance

LeagueFleets=4

LeagueHelium=0
    ; How much He3 to load into each fleet for League.
LeagueRank=10

    ; attempting to do them. Keep in mind that if somebody else has access to your alts, this could result in them
    ; fighting the bot for control of the alt. The bot harvests your alts warehouses periodically, this is controlled by
    ; AltsHarvestDelay. All other dailies are done once per day.

DisconnectDelay=3
    ; Number of seconds to wait before reloading after disconnection.
DoubleDisconnectDelay=60
    ; Number of seconds to wait before reloading after disconnection twice in a row. (I think)
ReconnectWait=30
    ; I think this is the number of seconds that controls the definition of "twice in a row". If you are disconnected
    ; and the bot reconnects, and it is disconnected again within this amount of time, it counts as a second disconnect.
    ; After that, it just counts as a normal disconnect.

    ; I think all these settings only apply to the bot when it is running your main account. The purpose appears to be
    ; to allow you to leave the bot running at home and login to your account from somewhere else to check up on it. I
    ; have the defaults set at DisconnectDelay=3, DoubleDisconnectDelay=60, and ReconnectWait=30. So with these
    ; settings, you can log on from work, and the bot will immediately reconnect and kick you off, unless it is busy
    ; running alts. This may be decent protection against somebody else logging on to your account and screwing up the
    ; bot. But then if you reconnect within 30 seconds, then the bot will give you 60 seconds to check your stuff before
    ; reconnecting and continuing. You can set the numbers low to make the bot always aggressively reconnect, or you can
    ; set them high to give yourself more time on a remote login.

AltsRetryDelay=3
    ; Number of seconds to wait before retrying an alt task after disconnection, if alts are set to retry that task.

ScreenSaver=10

    ; You have to adjust this manually if your computer automatically adjusts for Daylight Saving Time.

    ; friends list. Leave it blank [] to search the entire friends list, including Facebook friends.

    ; This setting is useful for making sure that your alts don't all steal from the same people and crowd each other
    ; out of steals. If you write your alts in a circle again as described in Readme.txt, the method I use is to have

    ; from the zodiac screen, the rest are for the individual instances. If more Constellations are added beyond the
    ; first 4 in each group, you should be able to expand the array and it will work. Just follow the pattern.
